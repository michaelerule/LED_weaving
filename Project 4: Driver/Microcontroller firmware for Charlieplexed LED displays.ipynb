This particular build is a larger multi-color version of the [Fibonacci spiral](https://crawlingrobotfortress.blogspot.com/2019/12/dreamcatcher.html) layout, and the construction steps are similar. This 'dagonal Charlieplexing' layout is, I think, [the easiest for hand-crafting](https://crawlingrobotfortress.blogspot.com/2019/02/led-multiplexing-layouts-for-hand.html), since it gets the maximum number of LEDs using the smallest amount of wire and microcontroller IO pins. \n",

We can explicitly avoid turning them on in the display driving code late to avoid this issue.\n",
    "\n",

I often check each LED before soldering.*\n",

    "Lighting LEDs individually works for small projects, but not for large ones. As the number of lights increases, the fraction of time that each light spends on decreases, making the display dim. There also isn't enough time to scan a large number of lights without introducing noticeable flicker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to scan an entire row or column of the matrix at once. One can drive multiple LEDs simultaneously by (e.g.) turning on one anode and multiple cathodes (but take care not to over-current the microcontroller IO pins). Appendix 1 (at the end of this post) gives notes for setting resistor values, but the usual series resistance for lighting a single LED is a good upper bound.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Single-light scanning\n",
    " - **Good:** If only a sparse subset of the LEDs are on at a given time, this can lead to a brighter and more uniform display.\n",
    " - **Bad:** The display will be dim if there are many LEDs to scan, and this approach fails if a large number LEDs need to be lit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Row/Column scanning\n",
    " - **Good:** Reduces the amount of CPU time needed to scan the display. Reduces flicker and increases brightness for large displays.\n",
    " - **Bad:** Current-limiting resistors set a fixed current per row or column. This means that the brightness depends on the number of LEDs being lit per row/column, which can lead to non-uniform brightness if not compensated in software. Handling displays that mix LEDs with different forward voltages is also more complicated.\n",

I'm using an AtMega328 board, which has three ports (B, C, and D). Quoting the [Arduino tutorial on port manipulation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PortManipulation), each port is controlled by three registers:\n",

    "This section is surveys different ways to use display-driver timer interrupts on the Arduino. The AtMega ([datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf)) has three timers available for generating timer interrupts. On the Arduino, these [timers are used for the following functions](http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/arduino-timer-interrupts):\n",
    "\n",
    " - Timer0: for the Arduino functions delay(), millis() and micros().\n",
    " - Timer1: for the [Servo library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo/blob/master/src/avr/ServoTimers.h)\n",
    " - Timer2: for the [Tone library](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/advanced-io/tone/)\n",
    " - All three timers are used for the PWM pins on the Arduino\n",
    "\n",
    "Each timer counts upwards, from 0 up to to 255 for 8-bit timers (Timers 0 and 2), and up to 6555 for 16-bit timers (Timer 1).\n",
    "AVR chips support several different ways to trigger interrupts based on these timers. For further reading, there are many good introductions to AVR timer interrupts online (e.g. [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-2/timers),\n",

    "I also found [Nick Gammon's](http://www.gammon.com.au/interrupts) and [Pramoth Thangaval's](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-interrupt-tutorial-with-examples) overviews of AVR interrupts helpful.\n",

The typical [\"flicker fusion\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold) frequency for humans is about 60 Hz in the fovea, but higher for some people and in the peripheral vision. A target a refresh frequency of about 200 Hz works well. For a display with $N$ rows/columns, one must scan the rows at $N\\cdot 200$ Hz. (For this project, I have 18 control lines so I need to scan the rows of the display at 3.6 kHz, or about every 280 microseconds, ideally.)\n",

    " 1. One can change the system clock rate: This is possible if working with bare AVR chips.\n",
    " 2. One can change the timer prescaler: This is the multiple of the clock rate at which the timer \"tics\". E.g. a timer with a prescaler of 32 increments by one every 32 clock cycles.\n",
    " 3. One can change the value of an \"output compare\" register, which sets when then next interrupt will trigger. This quite flexible, as it allows timer interrupts to be triggered in non-power-of-two multiples of the timer tic rate, e.g. every 33 tics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option (1) is unavailable on the Arduino, since the system clock is fixed. We also can't change timer pre-scalers (2) without disrupting other Arduino libraries, and using approach (3) to reset the timer at a certain value would also be disruptive.\n",

    "All is not lost. It would be rare to use both the Servo and Tone libraries on a LED display project. This means that Timers 1 and 2 will usually be available. Smaller displays can also be run of Timer 1 without changing its configuration.\n",

    "#### Timer interrupts as used by the Arduino environment on AtMega328-based boards\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look in detail how the various timers and associated interrupts are used by the Arduino library in the default configuration. The header file [`avr/interrupt.h`](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__interrupts.html) defines the interrupts available on AVR microcontrollers. On the AtMega328 chips, we have the following timer interrupts:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Timer 0\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `TIMER0_OVF_vect` *Timer 0 Overflow*  is [used for the millisecond clock in Arduino](https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=45331.0). On a 16 MHz Arduino Uno, [this counter increments every 4 μs](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/22237/40716), and overflows every 1.024 ms.\n",
    "   - `TIMER0_COMPA_vect` and `TIMER0_COMPB_vect` *Timer 0 Compare Match A and B* are [both](https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-2/timers) [available](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/1064/using-timer0-compb-vect), and can be used to register an interrupt routine triggered every every 1.024 ms on a 16 MHz system. This is sufficient to update a display with 16 rows/columns at 60 Hz, but only 5 rows/columns at 200 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Timer 1\n",
    "   - `TIMER1_COMPA_vect` *Timer 1 Compare Match A* is unavailable if using the [Servo library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo/blob/master/src/avr/Servo.cpp), which sets Timer 1 to increment every 2 MHz (0.5 μs) on a 16 MHz system. This is a 16-bit counter which overflows every 65,536 tics, approximately every 32.8 ms.\n",
    "   - `TIMER1_COMPB_vect` and `TIMER1_OVF_vect` *Timer 1 Compare Match B* and *Timer 1 Overflow* are available, but set to trigger every 32.8 ms if using the Servo library. This is too slow for driving a LED display.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Timer 2:\n",
    "   - `TIMER2_COMPA_vect` Timer 2 Compare Match A; This is unavailable if using the [Tone library](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/blob/master/cores/arduino/Tone.cpp). When playing a tone, the Tone library may reset the value of Timer 2 after a certain value that depends on the tone frequency.\n",
    "   - `TIMER2_COMPB_vect` and `TIMER2_OVF_vect` *Timer/Counter2 Compare Match B* and *Timer/Counter2 Overflow* are available, but the frequency at which these interrupts trigger depends on the tone being played by the Tone library, and might not trigger at all during tones. This makes it unsuitable for scanning a LED display.\n",
    "\n",
    "***In summary, we have the following options:***\n",
    "\n",
    " - Strict compatibility with the Servo and Tone libraries leaves us with the $\\approx$ 1 kHz system Timer 1 output-compare interrupts A and B, which is sufficient for driving smaller displays.\n",
    " - If only using one of the Servo or Tone libraries, once can use Timer 2 and Timer 1 (respectively) for display updates. This is by far the easiest approach, provided you do not need to use these libraries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hacking Timer 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a hack to get ~4 kHz interrupts on the ~1 kHz Timer 1 without disrupting any Arduino timer functionality. This is compatible with the timer configuration for both the Servo and the Tone libraries (although things may break if you run out of CPU cycles to handle all interrupts promptly).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use both output compare interrupts A and B with a phase offset of 64 tics. In the initialization code, set OCR0A to trigger on tic 0 and OCR0B to trigger on tic 64:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "// Enable Timer 0 output-compare interrupts A and B\n",
    "OCR0A = 0;\n",
    "OCR0B = 64;\n",
    "TIMSK0 |= 6;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Move the display scanning code to its own subroutine e.g `scan_display()`. Call this subroutine from *both* the output-compare A and B interrupt handlers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "SIGNAL(TIMER0_COMPA_vect) {\n",
    "  OCR0A += 128;\n",
    "  scan_display();\n",
    "}\n",
    "SIGNAL(TIMER0_COMPB_vect) {\n",
    "  OCR0B += 128;\n",
    "  scan_display();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least: change the output-compare register values in the interrupt handlers (e.g. `OCR0A += 128`). This causes each interrupt to be triggered every 128 tics rather than 256 tics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have two interrupts that trigger twice, this gives us 4 evenly-spaced interrupts during the Timer 1 cycle. For the default configuration on a 16 MHz AtMega*8-based board, this gives us a scan rate of 4.096 kHz. If you don't need a 4 kHz scan rate, you can just use one output-compare interrupt to achieve a 2 kHz rate with this trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I tried to push this even further, for example trying `OCR0A += 64` or `OCR0A += 32`, I ran into issues with flickering in the display. I'm not sure why; it might be related to the large (18) number of control lines that I'm using. You might want to experiment with this and let me know how it goes!\n",
